# â˜• Usage
```
Enyemeep [-h] -t IP -p PORTS [-v VERBOSITY] [-O] [-Pn] [--colorize] [-o [OUTPUT]] [-r]

Look for open ports

options:
  -h, --help                    Show this help message and exit

  -t IP, --target IP            Ip to scan, can be a range.

  -p PORTS, --port PORTS        Which port/s do you want to scan, if multiple, use commas port1,port2,port

  -v VERBOSITY, --verbose VERBOSITY
                        Verbosity level: 
                          0 (Default): Show only open ports
                          1: Show all ports even if they seem closed
                          2: Show all ports with full verbosity
                          3: Show debug messages

  -O, --os              Get OS from TTL

  -Pn, -8--D            Assume all targets are online

  --colorize            Get colorized output

  -o [FILE], --output [FILE]        Write a file with all the open/closed ports, verbosity level is used to write,
                                    default path is /tmp/enymeep-<date>.txt

  -r, --randomize                Randomize port scan order, this makes the scan more silent
                                 (like an elephant wearing yarn socks)
